        The European Commission is the executive branch of the European Union, responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties, and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. It operates as a cabinet government, with 27 members of the Commission (one from each member state) led by a President. The Commission's main roles include developing strategies and policies, enforcing EU laws, and negotiating international agreements on behalf of the EU.
      </P>
      <P>
        Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Competition (DG COMP) plays a critical role. DG COMP is responsible for establishing and implementing competition policy to ensure fair competition within the EU internal market. This includes enforcing antitrust laws, overseeing mergers and acquisitions, and preventing monopolistic practices and state aid that could distort competition. DG COMP works to protect consumers and businesses by promoting innovation, ensuring a level playing field, and enhancing economic efficiency.
      </P>
      <P>
        Israel worked at DG COMP, contributing to the Commission's efforts to maintain competitive markets and foster economic growth across the European Union.

            <Center>Project 1: Definition of Two RESTful APIs</Center>
          </Heading>

          <P>The first project involved defining two RESTful APIs that implemented the Richardson Maturity Model Level 3, incorporating HATEOAS. These APIs were designed as platforms for the secure exchange of legal documents in anti-cartel proceedings.</P>
          <P><b>Internal API</b>: The first API was intended to serve the internal staff of the European Commission.</P>
          <P><b>External API</b>: The second API served as a platform for external personnel.</P>
          <P>Both APIs featured access control through a Single Sign-On system called CAS. Data persistence was managed using both Oracle DB and MongoDB. Additionally, the APIs were integrated with an internal secure document storage project via a SOAP interface. The workflow of each procedure was managed using the State design pattern, and system administrators were notified of status changes via email.</P>
