# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project has been created to showcase my work and skills as a web developer. Below, you will find a description of how this portfolio was built, including the technologies used and some key features.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: This portfolio is built with Next.js, a React framework that enables static generation and server-side rendering, ensuring fast performance and a better user experience. Next.js also makes SEO optimization easier, which is crucial for an online portfolio.

- **Blender**: The 3D animations featured in this portfolio were created using Blender, a powerful 3D modeling software. Blender allowed me to design 3D models and scenes that were later integrated into the web application.

- **Three.js**: To implement the 3D animations in the browser, I used Three.js. This library facilitates the rendering of 3D graphics on the web and has been fundamental in bringing Blender animations to life within the Next.js application.

## Features

- **Modern and Responsive Interface**: The portfolio is designed to provide a smooth user experience across both mobile devices and desktop screens.
- **3D Animations**: Thanks to the combination of Blender and Three.js, the portfolio includes interactive 3D animations that enhance the visual experience and demonstrate my skills in developing advanced graphics.

- **SEO Optimized**: By using Next.js, I was able to optimize the portfolio for search engines, improving its online visibility and making it easier for others to find my work.
