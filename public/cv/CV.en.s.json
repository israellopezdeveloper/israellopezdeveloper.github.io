To achieve this, I integrated Prometheus into Devo's infrastructure, setting up robust metrics and alerts collection mechanisms. I defined key performance indicators (KPIs) and key thresholds to maintain system health and stability. In addition to setting up the alert system, I developed a comprehensive troubleshooting guide to assist the operations team in diagnosing and resolving problems quickly. The guide ensured that team members had a clear understanding of how to handle different types of alerts, from minor performance degradations to critical system failures. To improve the overall effectiveness of the monitoring system, I also designed protocols to handle critical system situations.

At the core of the communication system is a Kafka-based messaging cluster, where communication with devices is managed through Avro schemes. This gateway system was developed in Go, using the ModBus communications protocol in its serial and TCP versions, with TCP communications secured via a VPN. My practical approach and technical expertise were essential to tackling the challenges of renewable energy distribution, and my contribution to harnessing advanced technologies and developing robust communication protocols underlines my significant role in this innovative project aimed at improving the stability and efficiency of the use of renewable energy within the electricity grid.</p>",

      "contribution": "<p>I have extensive experience working as a remote senior programmer on three important projects. In this role, I was entrusted with a variety of critical responsibilities that required both technical expertise and strong communication skills. One of my main duties was to attend meetings with the product owner to define the detailed requirements of the project. This involved a thorough analysis of the project objectives and break them down into specific and processable tasks. To facilitate fluid communication and collaboration, I translated and interpreted the requirements into Chinese. This linguistic skill was crucial to overcome communication gaps and ensure that all team members, regardless of their location, had a clear and accurate understanding of the project requirements. I used the SCRUM methodology to ensure that all tasks were organized and managed effectively throughout the project lifecycle. This involved creating detailed plans, setting realistic timelines, and continually monitoring progress to ensure that project milestones were met. Overall, my experience as a senior remote programmer has provided me with a diverse skill set and a deep understanding of effective project management in a remote and global work environment. My ability to define detailed requirements, coordinate with international teams, innovate to improve productivity and manage projects using SCRUM has allowed me to contribute significantly to the success of the projects I have been involved in.</p>",

One of my main tasks was to conduct comprehensive research on the state of the art in various areas, including accessibility issues, AI algorithms, artificial vision and biometric systems. In addition to my research duties, I actively participated in collaborations with research groups from different universities. Another key aspect of my role was preparing detailed reports on our research findings. In addition, I participated in the study and application for State aid and grants for research and development (R&D) projects, which required a thorough understanding of the financing landscape and the ability to develop compelling proposals that demonstrated the importance and potential impact of our research. My teaching role allowed me to share my passion for AI and artificial vision with the next generation of researchers and professionals, while remaining committed to the academic community.</p>",

The main objective of this research was to develop and refine technologies that could facilitate more intuitive and accessible interactions with various types of systems, including desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices. This included developing specialized input devices, adaptive software solutions, and advanced user interface designs that specifically tailored to the needs of users with visual, auditory, and motor disabilities. By integrating feedback from real users, our research group was able to make significant strides in creating devices and applications that not only met accessibility standards, but also improved the overall user experience for people with disabilities.</p>",

This RPC system ensured that communication between devices remained transparent regardless of the programming language or operating system used. The project required careful consideration of interoperability issues, as biometric devices often come with proprietary communication protocols and diverse technical specifications. By implementing a standardized RPC system, we were able to abstract the underlying differences and create a unified communication protocol. In addition, the communication system was designed to be highly robust and secure, given the sensitive nature of biometric data. This project not only improved the compatibility of devices but also paved the way for future advances in biometric technology, allowing manufacturers to focus on innovation without worrying about communication barriers.</p>",
