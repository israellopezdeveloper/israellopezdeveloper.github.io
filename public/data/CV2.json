The project utilizes clustering techniques, specifically the K-Means algorithm, applied to the dataset of legal documents from the anti-cartel department. The indexing process is integrated into a microservice designed with the gRPC framework, implemented in C++14 to ensure maximum efficiency and performance.",
            "The architecture of these microservices follows the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) paradigm, deployed on a service pool to guarantee resilience and rapid response times. The semantic search capability is powered by a neural network trained on the anti-cartel legal documents dataset, utilizing the TensorFlow framework. Additionally, Israel developed a complementary service in Java, which leverages this semantic search tool to enhance its functionality.",

The system's design emphasizes resilience, efficiency, and accuracy, making it a vital tool for legal document management and retrieval in the anti-cartel department.
