These terminals took information about the user's electricity consumption by sending a daily report to the server using the SNMP communication protocol, unless a more detailed monitoring was desired on a specific device or set of devices, in which case reports would be generated with a level of detail that would reach consumption per minute. These data were stored in a non-relational MongoDB database, which for obvious reasons were several clusters, with load balancing and replicated shards. The information of each point was stored in the cluster by geographical proximity, as long as the server was able to assume the volume of data that included the inclusion of said node. The information of each node was kept for one year with a level of detail of consumption per minute, after the year was compacted generating the maximum, minimum and average of each day and this information was kept at this level of detail for 5 years and past That time lapse the information from each node was compacted again. The system also gave the possibility to control and listen in real time to the device through the SNMP and JNLP protocol. This structure was created using microservices in C ++ with the remote procedure call framework gRPC and was implemented in a set of servers based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux."
